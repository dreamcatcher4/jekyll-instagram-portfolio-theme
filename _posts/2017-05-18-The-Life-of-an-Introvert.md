You’ve probably heard about the word [**Introvert**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/introvert). You might be called as one or somehow you yourself know that you are. Yes, you and I mean it! <br/>Everyone has been an introvert at some stage of your life or still being one now. Do you know that one out of every two or three people is an introvert? So if you are one don’t let yourself down, you’re not alone.

After computer geeks being called nerds, Introverts are the next most misunderstood people in the society. Due to their eccentric behavior in public, people treat them as socially awkward and arogant. It isn’t true that they are weird or something, its just that they lack interest in socializing with people. They even get called by names as a psychopath, selfish, sad, depressed and what not they are the ones who get picked up by bullies everytime.

### Have you ever wondered how an introvert leads his life? 
Here are a few words of an introvert depicting his life. 
<br/>*“I being an introvert never cared much about the outside world. I find happiness in being myself and see other people tiring. I don't hate people, i just hate being bothered. All that matters for me is my own world. Even my family and friends treat me like if I have been possessed by some spirits or suffering from mental disorder issues. Gradually my strange behavior of being myself and staying away from everything started to make people judge me."*

"It isn’t a disease or some kind of spirit in them, it’s just being themselves which makes them unique."

### "Don’t they hate it living such a life?" you may ask! 
They are the most happiest people to live a peaceful life. Who hates their life when they are living the life they have been dreaming all day and enjoying the beautiful things to themselves. We being normal people always want to be praised and taken care of! Because that’s how a we live our lives being selfish and unstasified. 

Life isn’t easy for anyone, be it an introvert or a normal person. Introverts are not against people, they just tend to maintain small groups of friends. That doesn’t mean they don’t have much to talk to, it’s just that they feel like they don’t fit in this society. They might be hard to know from the outside but mostly give place to someone who truly understands the way they are.
<br/>They aren't shy, or that’s not what which stops them to interact with people. They are really good at meeting new people and act more like an extrovert most of the time.

### How do you get out of this introversion?
Well It’s good to be yourself, but not all the time. The world needs you. We humans are meant to work as a community. Open up to the people around you and throw yourself into small talks occasionally. Those small talks would help you in making your life easier and bring you out of your introversion.
<br/>Here’s a real life example of one our dreamer. 
<br/>*“I always used to stick around with my work keeping myself busy. Later on, when I have shared my knowledge and the plans that burried deep in my mind for the very first time, that really changed my way of perception. Which made me think that I should be more outgoing.”* 
<br/> These are the small instances in our daily life which give us the message that somehow this non-human like, the quiet and introverted behavior is not the right way to go.

One thing that every human is supposed to do is interact, but being an introvert, you find it difficult and stay in your own world. Get a hold over your thoughts and, just ask yourself “why am I different? Am I supposed to be like this or made this happen to myself?” Overcome your shy and fear! Those are the things which stop you from reaching the outside world and keep you entrapped within the unknown darkness that you have created deep inside you. 

You’re living your life the way you want, but that’s not how it works. We need to have people around us, “Life is hard to live all by yourself.” You may find its unnecessary to open up to everyone, but it’s not just you having a hard time being as an introvert, there are a lot more like you in the world, and this is totally a community loss!
